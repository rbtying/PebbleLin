=========

This project includes code for an "air violin" developed on a Pebble smartwatch and an Android smartphone. Here, the Pebble acts as the "bow" for the violin, while the phone acts as a "fret". The angle of the watch and which button is pressed on the companion phone app determine the pitch that is produced, while the speed of the watch determines the volume. This project was developed as a hack for PennApps Spring 2014.
